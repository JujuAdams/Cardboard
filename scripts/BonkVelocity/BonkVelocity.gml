/// Constructor to make a struct that contains 3D velocity data. This struct is required when using
/// `BonkMoveAndCollide()`. Struct are created with three member variables, `xSpeed` `ySpeed` and
/// `zSpeed`, that encode the three components of the velocity. You may get and set these variables
/// as you see fit.
/// 
/// Structs created by this constructor have two methods:
/// 
/// `.GetSpeed()`
///     Return the scalar speed that the struct represents. This is the "length" of the velocity
///     vector.
/// 
/// `.Reset()`
///     Sets the x, y, and z components of the velocity to 0.
/// 
/// The struct created by the constructor contains the following values:
/// 
/// `.xSpeed` `.ySpeed` `.zSpeed`
///     Components of the velocity vector.
/// 
/// @param [xSpeed=0]
/// @param [ySpeed=0]
/// @param [zSpeed=0]
