## About & Support

Cardboard supports all GameMaker export modules, including consoles, mobile, and Opera GX. Cardboard also works on HTML5 but YoYoGames' lacklustre support for this platform can make bug fixing hard if you run into anything. If you'd like to report a bug or suggest a feature, please use the repo's [Issues page](https://github.com/JujuAdams/Cardboard/issues). Cardboard is constantly being maintained and upgraded; bugs are usually addressed within a few days of being reported.

Cardboard is built and maintained by [@jujuadams](https://twitter.com/jujuadams) who has a long history of tinkering with 3D rendering in GameMaker. Juju's worked on a lot of [commercial GameMaker games](http://www.jujuadams.com/).

This library will never truly be finished because contributions and suggestions from new users are always welcome. Scribble wouldn't be the same without [your](https://tenor.com/search/whos-awesome-gifs) input! Make a suggestion on the repo's [Issues page](https://github.com/JujuAdams/Cardboard/issues) if you'd like a feature to be added.
